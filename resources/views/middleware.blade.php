        This section provides an overview of middleware in Laravel.
    <p>
        I learned that in Laravel, you can create custom middleware to handle specific functionality for your application. 
        This includes validating user requests, checking if a user is authenticated, or logging request details.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned how to create middleware using the Artisan command, which allows you to define the logic that will run before or after a request is processed.
        Additionally, i learned how to modify kernel and how to register middleware so that it can function properly.
