    <h1>1st Laboratory</h1>
        <h2>This includes the installation of laravel, and developing routes and views.</h2>
    <p>
    This section includes the lessons learned in using laravel as a framework for developing websites. I installed laravel along with its dependencies,
    ensuring that my environment is setup properly with the parameters i chose. Then i modified the 'env' file so that my project can work properly without any errors.
    i then created views for the homepage, about us page, and welcome pages.
