    <p>
        This section includes the lessons learned in using Laravel as a framework for developing websites. 
        I installed Laravel along with its dependencies, ensuring that my environment is set up properly with the parameters I chose. 
        Then I modified the 'env' file so that my project can work properly without any errors. 
        I then created views for the homepage, about us page, and welcome pages.
